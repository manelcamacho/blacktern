Black tern 0.7c (BKT) is an open source program to calculate the values of the wave velocity field under linear wave theory and 2nd/3rd order stokes wave theory, and 5th order using the results of R.Jensen and Fenton for currents at u=0 (currents will be added at versions>0.7c) the program uses a .txt file with ordered values to read the main wave properties as the amplitude and period. The program then writes the wave field values into several .txt files. The program will produce the ourput of the velocity components along the water column as also a separate file that contains some data as amplitude, period, frequency, average power per square meter, depth of interaction and the maximum velocities that the waves will induce in the water column.

Each wave component read from the source text file, will produce an (x,y) output file and one final spectral file with some ofthe wave component propierties given the wave hieght that has been used; the next files explain how this program is used, its aim, the more probable road map and other useful stuff.

The process of use, installation and general description of the program along with its GPl license and example data y located at the .zip file in BKT0_7c.zip, to know more just read the README.txt file that is located at the same zip file.
