Black tern 0.3 is an open source program to calculate the values of the wave velocity field under linear wave theory and 2nd order stokes wave theory, the program uses a .txt file with ordered values to read the main wave properties as the amplitude and period. The program then writes the wave field values into several .txt files. 

Each wave component read from the source text file, will produce an (x,y) output file, the next files explain how this program is used:

Input-output: describes how to enter the wave data and the output we will have.
Installation: describes the installation process.
Data: provides a very brief file with data as an example to use into Blacktern.
Theory: Gives links to the wave theory used for the calculations.
Inner-workings: Describes how the code works internally.
Road-map: Describes the steps to implement version from 0.1 to 0.5.
Aim of the code: Describes what is the purpose fo the code.
Howto: How to use, how it works, example and possible issues.
Documentation: Code.
