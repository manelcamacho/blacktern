Installation: for 0.5

Blacktern is a pure C code, due to this the installation process only consists
only into compile it using gcc. As it has not external libraries the process
for version 0.1 consists only on downloading the .c code and then executing
at your terminal:

gcc blacktern.c -o Blacktern

then to run it you just type at the same folder where you compile it

./Blacktern

After compile it you can also just run it by clicking on it. It is also advised
that the file containing the wave parameters to be calculated should be in the
same folder as Blacktern in order for Blacktern to run.


Installation: for 0.6

Black tern is a pure C program, due to this can be installed into any machine that supports a gcc compiler. So far the code can be compiled and execute in BSD, OSX, Linux and covers any platform that supports a gcc compiler, so far it uses C99 standard and can be run on an X86-64 platform as any AMD/INTEL powered device or any ARM machine like the Apple-M1/Raspberry-Cortex.

Install instructions:
• Download the BKT0_6.zip file and data.txt file and unzip BKT0_6.zip.

• Move the data.txt file to the same folder created by unzipping BKT0_6.zip, if it tells you that there is other file with the same name it does not matter as maybe I just placed to copies of the same data.txt file.

• Go to the terminal in your system and navigate to the folder BKT0_6, usually you will do this by using the command cd. If lets us say your file is at downloads then you will usually do “cd /username/downloads/BKT0_6”, need to say that username its your computer username and if your system is case sensitive as BSD/Linux then you might need to put “cd /username/Downloads/BKT0_6”.

• Now that it is open, you have two options; you can just compile Blacktern as it is using the command: gcc Blacktern0_6.c -L. -lprop -ldata -lcomp -lfields -o Blacktern0_6 or you can compile library by library and then blacktern, this is described in the next step. If you have some problems in BSD-Linux jump to the possible issues section.

• To comile library by library you will need to run the command: gcc -c namethefile.c for each file in the folder BKT0_6 except the Blacktern0_6.c, then you will need to link each file to their respective library. When you compiled using: gcc -c namethefile.c a set of .o files are created, each file goes inside a library so search for the .h files and take note of each file name inside then run: ar -rc libraryname.a name ofthefile.o and at the end just run: gcc Blacktern0_6.c -L. -lprop -ldata -lcomp -lfields -o Blacktern0_6 I would never recommend this for someone that has short experience in .nix like systems.

• Run the command: ls

• After running the command you should see a new executable file named Blacktern0_6.

• It is done!, easy isn’t???!!!
