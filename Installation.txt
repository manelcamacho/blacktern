Installation:

Blacktern is a pure C code, due to this the installation process only consists
only into compile it using gcc. As it has not external libraries the process
for version 0.1 consists only on downloading the .c code and then executing
at your terminal:

gcc blacktern.c -o Blacktern

then to run it you just type at the same folder where you compile it

./Blacktern

After compile it you can also just run it by clicking on it. It is also advised
that the file containing the wave parameters to be calculated should be in the
same folder as Blacktern in order for Blacktern to run.
