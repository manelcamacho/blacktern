Use:

To use black tern prepare a file called data.txt with the data as:

Wave height1 Period1 DX1 DZ1 DT1
Wave height2 Period2 DX2 DZ2 DT2
Wave height3 Period3 DX3 DZ3 DT3
Wave height4 Period4 DX4 DZ4 DT4
.
.
.
AmplitudeN PeriodN DXN DZN DTN

The numbers are the components of the waves from 1 to N, the meaning of DX, DZ
and DT is explained in the input-output file. Store the file in the same folder
as Blacktern is. 

Open the folder where blacktern is stored and open a terminal session, then just type ./blacktern data.txt
The program will ask for the wave latitude where this is being modeled, the gravity component will be calculated
using a simple geodesic projection. The program will also ask for the depth where these wave systems are 
being propagated.

Blacktern will then produce the pressure gradient and the wave velocity components of the waves stored in several 
files with an x for the velocity components and a p for the pressure components. If the waves are moving in transitional 
waters the file will contain a t and will also contains a 1 or 2 if the long wave systems are of linear or second order nature.

Blacktern will also produce a secondary file with some spectral information as the maximum wave velocities
induced at the surface, the depth of interaction if moving in depth waters, the power in watts per square 
meter at the surface and the frequency of the wave systems.
