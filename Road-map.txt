ed Future work:

 Blacktern is not a completed work, as the version suggest blacktern is a port of programs that
 were written during my PHD to provide tools to calculate wave propierties and wave velocities. 
 Blacktern components are mostly implemented in diverse individual tools, the aim of Blacktern 
 is to gather these tools into an united functional tool.
 
 The next steps to improve and keep building over the already done work are:

 Version 0.1
 -Calculation of linear wave velocities in deep waters->done
 -Allow user defined file of data->done.
 
 Version 0.2:

 -Calculation of linear waves in transitonal deep waters->done (not implemented as solutions are to small)
 -User defined path/name to the file were the wave propierties are stored->done
 -Manual/How-to->done
 -initial documentation->in process


 Version 0.3:

 -Calculation of linear waves in shallow waters->done
 -Re-make function to divide linear from 2nd order waves ->done, some problems were found to fit the function that divides the space between Airy and 2nd Order, the boundary where h->0 and H->0 at the limit in h=0.2 ended abrutly then making the waves to calculate wrong their order.  
 -(Posponed util version 1.X)Use of PTHREADS to improve the speed of the calcuations making use of multicores->done but not implemented, dynamic allocation of cores, memory and arrays has been posponed to version 1.X as this processes will requiere a rewriting of all code and more heavy tools.
 -Testing compilation on Linux (problems with memory functions)->done/solved

 
 Version 0.4:
-Statistical functions to define some characteristcs of the components (pre version)->gathering information (possible only basic functions), calculation of spectral density by power formula, maximum velocities, frequency component and depth of interaction. Velocities are calculated along the maximums of each theory that fts the waves. The power spectra will be changed at 0.5 as this depends on the density (T/Pressure variant).
-Calculation of power coefficients of each components->done
-Start basic documentation->in work
-Comparision against linear wave data using other software tools->partially done: linear deep water waves and transitional water waves.
 -Testing compilation on BSD->done


Version 0.5
 -Calculation of power density depending on variables that change the water mass->In review as its must suffice that changes are important enought to be taken into account, done it is already on the spectral file produced.
 -Testing of simple current profiles in the water column->in work, will be added to 0.6.
 -Calculation of second order waves -> done,will go to 0.3.
 -Algorithm to define if a wave is linear or second order, based on an apprximate mapping of the nondimensional wave propierties as functions of f(nd,nh) where 
 nd=non-dimensional deopth and nh= non-dimensional height-> done, it will go to 0.3
 -Comparision against linear wave data using other software tools on 2nd order model-> partially done under transitional water waves at 2nd order, in process to complete.
 -Calculation of the pressure gradient below the water-In work, done it is currently implemented into 0.5!.
 -Calculation of spectral data as frequency, power and maximum induced velocities per spectra->done!.

 Version 0.6:
 -Disband of libraries to make the code more functional->done.
 -Expansion of statistical functions to derive information from the 1st and 2nd order swell waves composing the given spectrum-->done.
 
 Version 0.6a:
 -Review for errors and comparision against other tools->in the making!.
  Version 0.6b:
  -Influence of physical-chemical gardients in the column.
  Version 0.6c:
  -Added functions and more optimization of the code speed.
  
 
 

Version 0.7:
-Algorithm to define stepper wave systems of 3rd, 4th and 5th order->done but not implemented->done using simple apped functions.
-Calculation of third, 4th and 5th order wave system velocities.

Version 0.8:
-Fitting techniques to calculate the wave profile velocity.
-Re-do manual in pdf.
-Re-made documentation.

Version 0.9
-Integration simple current models in the water column.
-Fitting techniques for the overall flow profile along the water column.

Version 1.0
-Integration of simple turbulence layer at bottom
-Re-do manual in pdf.
-Re-do documentation.
-Start parallel GUI* (Not joined with black tern but as an add on)

Pre 1.1
-REwrite of the code using dynamic memory allocation, core dynamic, dynamic individual data streams.

Release and start merging with white crow(wind wave spectra program) and grey rabbit (IA interpreting engine)
