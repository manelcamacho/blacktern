Future work:

 Blacktern is not a completed work, as the version suggest blacktern is a port of programs that
 were written during my PHD to provide tools to calculate wave propierties and wave velocities. 
 Blacktern components are mostly implemented in diverse individual tools, the aim of Blacktern 
 is to gather these tools into a functional tool.
 
 The next steps to improve and keep building over the already done work are:

 Version 0.2:

 -Calculation of linear waves in shallow and transitonal deep waters->done
 -Use of PTHREADS to improve the speed of the calcuations making use of multicores->todo
 -User defined path/name to the file were the wave propierties are stored->done
 -Manual on pdf->todo

 Version 0.3:

 -Calculation of second order waves.
 -Algorithm to define if a wave is linear or second order, based on an apprximate mapping of the nondimensional wave propierties as functions of f(nd,nh) where 
 nd=non-dimensional deopth and nh= non-dimensional hiegh->done but not implemented

 Version 0.4:
 -Creation of libraries to make the code more functional

Version 0.5:
-Algorithm to define stepper wave systems of 3rd, 4th and 5th order->done but not implemented
-Calculation of third, 4th and 5th order wave system velocities.
