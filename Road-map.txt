Future work:

 Blacktern is not a completed work, as the version suggest blacktern is a port of programs that
 were written during my PHD to provide tools to calculate wave propierties and wave velocities. 
 Blacktern components are mostly implemented in diverse individual tools, the aim of Blacktern 
 is to gather these tools into a functional tool.
 
 The next steps to improve and keep building over the already done work are:

 Version 0.1
 -Calculation of linear wave velocities in deep waters->done
 -Allow user defined file of data->done.
 
 Version 0.2:

 -Calculation of linear waves in transitonal deep waters->done
 -User defined path/name to the file were the wave propierties are stored->done
 -Manual on pdf->todo
 -initial documentation->todo


 Version 0.3:

 -Calculation of linear waves in shallow waters->done
 -Use of PTHREADS to improve the speed of the calcuations making use of multicores->todo

 
 Version 0.4:
-Statistical functions to define some characteristcs of the components (pre version)
-Start basic documentation


Version 0.5
 -Calculation of second order waves.
 -Algorithm to define if a wave is linear or second order, based on an apprximate mapping of the nondimensional wave propierties as functions of f(nd,nh) where 
 nd=non-dimensional deopth and nh= non-dimensional hiegh->done but not implemented

 Version 0.6:
 -Disband of libraries to make the code more functional
 -Expansion of statistical functions to derive information from the 1st and 2nd order swell waves composing the given spectrum

Version 0.7:
-Algorithm to define stepper wave systems of 3rd, 4th and 5th order->done but not implemented
-Calculation of third, 4th and 5th order wave system velocities.

Version 0.8:
-Fitting techniques to calculate the wave profile velocity.
-Re-do manual in pdf.
-Re-made documentation.

Version 0.9
-Integration simple current models in the water column.
-Fitting techniques for the overall flow profile along the water column.

Version 1.0
-Integration of simple turbulence layer at bottom
-Re-do manual in pdf.
-Re-do documentation.
-Start parallel GUI* (Not joined with black tern but as an add on)

Release and start merging with white crow(wind wave spectra program) and grey rabbit (IA interpreting engine)
